          This data visualization uses a map to show the distribution of people
          injured in traffic accidents in New York City in 2020. The size of the
          dots is used to represent the number of injuries in each accident, and
          the map is visually superimposed to show where the number of injuries
          is concentrated in New York City. The initial value of transparency is
          set at 90, which allows users to observe the results of data
          presentation at first glance, and different degrees of transparency
          can help reflect the observation results more accurately.

          This data visualization uses a scatter plot to show and compare the
          number of injuries in each borough of New York City due to traffic
          accidents in 2020. Data in unmarked areas on the dataset are shown as
          blue dots. It can be seen that the number of injuries in Brooklyn and
          Queens is relatively high, and the government should focus on
          prevention first in these two areas to greatly reduce the casualty
          rate of accidents.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div id="v3"></div>
        <p>
          This data visualization uses a stacked bar chart to show the trends
          over time in the number of injuries in each borough of New York City
          due to traffic accidents in 2020, and compares them. Data in unmarked
          areas on the dataset are shown as blue dots. It can be seen that the
          change trend of casualties in the Bronx area and the Staten island
          area is relatively flat, and the change trends in other areas
          fluctuate to a certain extent, sometimes increasing and sometimes
          decreasing.

        <div id="v4"></div>
        <p>
          This data visualization uses a scatter plot to show the relationship
          between the number of injured and the number of deaths in each
          district. This data visualization shows not a trend comparison of
          proportions between casualties, but independent proportions by
          district. The degree of mortality can be intuitively judged by
          imagining the slope of the line between the point and the origin. A
          flat line has a lower degree of mortality, and a steeper line has a
          higher degree of mortality.

            This data visualization uses an area chart to show the types of
            vehicles involved in traffic accidents and their trends over time.
            This information partly indicates which types of vehicles have
            higher accident rates. People can use this as a reference when
            deciding on the type of vehicle to buy. Vehicle manufacturers can
            observe trends in accident rates to make vehicle safety
            improvements.

        <p>
          This data visualization uses a heat map to show the number of traffic
          casualties accurate to each day, each month. It can be seen that the
          number of casualties was higher in January, February, July, and
          August. The number of casualties decreased from mid-March until the
          end of May, and began to rebound again in June.
